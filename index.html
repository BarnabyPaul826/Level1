    <h1> Mahurangi College Litter Problem</h1>
      <p>
         I am currently a student at Mahurangi College and I have noticed that most places I go to through out this school I have seen litter on the ground or people just throwing their rubbish onto the ground.

       The litter problem in Mahuragni College is terrible. There are parts of the school that are either completely trashed or are really tidied. I have made this website to give insight about the litter problem about my school and how to get around it. In this website I have made a contact page to get into contact with me, A problems page to see further problems about the litter and a questions page for anyone to ask any questions about what is happening.

    "Littering is a crime, but they are not enforcing the law. We need to educate the    youths on why littering is bad and the effect litter has on neighbourhoods."

    It gives people the power to say ‘I just witnessed littering and I don’t like littering in my community. I’m going to turn this over and see if I can get this stopped.
